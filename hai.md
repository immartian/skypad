# **Questions Following Use Cases:**

### **1\. Domain Anchoring & Ontology**

* What existing naming conventions or taxonomies do your teams use internally (e.g., project types, furniture models, room types)?

* Is there a catalog or tag hierarchy that we can extract and refine into a working ontology?

* How important is visual style or branding identity to the way assets are organized?

### **2\. Data Access and Readiness**

* Where do the images and bid data currently live (file servers, cloud, shared drives)?

* Do we have metadata like timestamps, client names, or versioning?

* Are CRM and ERP systems accessible via API or only manually?

### **3\. Technical Decisions and Architecture**

* Are you imagining these use cases running independently, or should we unify them under a shared AI orchestration system (e.g., SkyPad Guru)?  
* Do you already have preferred vendors (for cloud, DAM, CRM integrations), or is this flexible?  
* Should we pursue rapid cloud-based services first, then gradually build internal intelligence?

### **4\. Feedback and Human Involvement**

* Who internally will curate, review, or manage tags, predictions, or suggestions from the AI?  
* Can we align early AI tools with existing team workflows so adoption is natural?

###  **5\. Phasing and Impact**

* Which use case would you consider a **“must-win”** in the first 3–6 months?  
* What does success look like? (e.g., reduced bid turnaround time, more searchable images, more qualified leads)

### **6\. Engagement Model**

* Are you open to starting with a short-term architecture sprint or discovery phase?  
* Do you envision me playing a hands-on technical role, an architect/advisor, or a hybrid over time?  
* some business questions like bids size and profit margin, compressive and expressive ratio today, etc.

## **Vision**

**Combined with Human and Artificial Intelligence(HAI), empowering Skypad to become the world’s top intelligent, responsive, and visionary furniture partner for luxury hospitality, by integrating AI-driven intelligence across design, operations, and client engagement.**

---

## **Core Objectives (What HAI Will Help Achieve)**

| Area | Goal |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Bidding Success** | Increase project bid success rate by 25–50% through smarter quoting, proposal optimization, and design personalization. |
| **Knowledge Sharing** | Centralize 24 years of project and vendor knowledge into a living system, enabling instant access, reuse, and innovation. |
| **Client Intelligence** | Predict client needs and preferences based on historical patterns and external market signals. |
| **Supply Chain Efficiency** | Optimize sourcing, vendor selection, and lead time management to reduce costs and delays by 15–30%. |
| **Operational Agility** | Detects risks and opportunities early in projects through real-time ERP/CRM monitoring and forecasting. |
| **Continuous Innovation** | Enable internal teams to explore new materials, sustainable practices, and design ideas through AI-scouted insights. |

## **Solution Framework (Architecture Overview Based on My Successful Stories)**

### **1\. Core Layer: Data Lakehouse**

* Aggregate ERP, CRM, VendorDB, and project files, including communications logs.

* Support structured and unstructured data.

* Enable future-proof analytics, ML, and BI.

### **2\. Intelligence Layer: Core Agent \+ Specialized Subagents**

* Vendor Intelligence Agent

* Client Insight Agent

* Design Optimizer Agent

* Operations and Timeline Agent

* Quoting & Proposal Agent

* Knowledge Graph for long-term memory

### **3\. System Integration Layer**

* Seamless connectors to live systems (low-risk, non-invasive).

* Event-driven architecture for near-real-time updates.

### **4\. Human-in-the-Loop Interfaces**

* Interactive Dashboards for conversations, ideas, approvals, insights, overrides.

* Natural language queries to Agent (We can call it, "Bella")

| Vendor & Supply Chain Intelligence "List top 5 vendors who delivered teak wood under 8 weeks in the last 2 years." "What is the predicted lead time for marble table tops if ordered next month?" "Which vendor gives the best price-performance for eco-certified fabrics?" "Find alternative suppliers if our Indonesian partners have delays." Client Intelligence & Project Customization "Summarize the design style preferences of Marriott group projects we've worked on." "What color palettes have been most used in coastal resort projects?"

## **Implementation Strategy (Agile \+ Recursive Development)  — 24+ Months Span**

| Phase | Focus | Deliverables |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Phase 0** | Baseline Assessment(1 month) | Map existing history documents(media), ERP, CRM, and Vendor systems; data quality audit. |
| **Phase 1** | Data Foundation(2-3 months) | Build the Lakehouse; basic ETL pipelines from ERP/CRM. |
| **Phase 2** | MVP Agents(2 months) | Deploy first Agent with 1–2 subagents (Vendor Intelligence \+ Client Insights). |
| **Phase 3** | Human-in-the-Loop(2 months) | Launch dashboards; gather user feedback loops. |
| **Phase 4** | Expansion(6-10 months) | Roll out Design and Operations agents; deepen Knowledge Graph. |
| **Phase 5** | Continuous Optimization(6-10 months) | Recursive learning: agents improve via feedback, retraining, better models quarterly. |

## **Key Principles**

* **Start Small, Scale Fast**: Prove value with minimum viable agents before scaling.

* **Human-AI Symbiosis**: AI augments, not replaces. Users are co-pilots.

* **Recursive Improvement**: Each release cycle gathers feedback, upgrades models, improves agent behavior.

* **Trust & Transparency**: Make AI decisions explainable to users to build confidence.

* **Business-Driven**: Every AI capability must tie back to clear business objectives (e.g., faster bids, better delivery).

---

## **Future Growth Pathways (Post-2030+)**

* Autonomous bidding agents that draft personalized proposals overnight.

* Digital twin of Skypad's supply chain for real-time optimization.

* AI copilots embedded in design software suggesting material innovations.

* Global client intelligence network that predicts hospitality design trends 12–18 months ahead.

* Skypad becomes not just a supplier—but a thought leader and innovation driver in luxury design.

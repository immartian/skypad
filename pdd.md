        self.self_model = identity  # Who am I?
        self.world_model = WorldSimulation()  # What is the context?
        self.memory_core = MemorySystem()  # What do I remember?
        self.action_predictor = OutcomeSimulator()  # What will happen if...?
    
    def recursive_simulation(self, situation):
        # Simulate self in situation
        self_in_context = self.self_model.project_into(situation)
        
        # Predict outcomes
        predicted_outcomes = self.action_predictor.simulate(self_in_context)
        
        # Update internal models based on predictions
        self.update_models(predicted_outcomes)
        
        return self.generate_response(predicted_outcomes)
```

## **User Experience Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: The Intuitive Discovery**
*Sarah, an interior designer, uploads a mood image of a Scandinavian café*

**Traditional Approach:**
- Manual keyword search
- Browse through categories
- Compare individual items

**Skypad AI Approach:**
```
Bella: "I sense you're drawn to the 'hygge minimalism' aesthetic in this image. 
The warm oak tones and clean lines suggest you're designing for comfort with sophistication. 

Based on similar projects, designers often pair this style with:
• Muuto Fiber chairs for that organic-modern feel
• Custom oak veneer tables with steel hairpin legs
• Brass accent lighting for warmth

Shall I show you how other designers have interpreted this aesthetic for hotel lobbies?"
```

### **Scenario 2: The Collaborative Design Session**
*A hotel chain's design team, architect, and Skypad representative meet virtually*

**Bella as Facilitator:**
```
Bella: "I notice the architect prefers bold statement pieces while the brand manager 
emphasizes guest comfort. Let me suggest a synthesis approach:

What if we use bold architectural elements (lighting, built-ins) while keeping 
furniture more approachable? I'm seeing successful examples from similar chains..."

[Generates real-time mood board showing the compromise approach]
```

### **Scenario 3: The Speculative Brief**
*Client asks: "Design a restaurant for a space hotel in 2040"*

**Imaginative Co-Creation:**
```
Bella: "Fascinating! For zero-gravity dining, I'm thinking:
• Modular seating that can be reconfigured in 3D space
• Magnetic-base tables that work at any angle  
• Materials: Bio-grown composites for sustainability
• Lighting: Full-spectrum LEDs mimicking Earth's natural light cycles

Let me show you concepts inspired by current aerospace interior design, 
combined with hospitality psychology research..."

[Generates speculative concept renderings]
